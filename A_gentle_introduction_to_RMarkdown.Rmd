## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot. The `eval = FALSE` parameter can be added to the code chunk to prevent running of the R code within the chunk.

```{r speed}
plot(cars$speed, cars$dist)
```

The **plot** function in base R is used to generate scatter plots showing the relationship between two numeric variables. The *independent* or *x variable* is the first one listed in the parentheses, and the second variable in the parentheses is the *dependent* or *y variable*.

Beautiful plots can be created in R using the basic **plot** function, but there are many packages that can be used to create a wider range of nice-looking plots. *ggplot2* is one such package.

```{r ggplot2-mtcars}
#install.packages("ggplot2")
library(ggplot2)
p <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(wt, mpg))
p + geom_point(aes(size = qsec, colour = factor(cyl)))
```

Running this chunk displays the code for calling in the *ggplot2* package with the **library** command and creating a scatter plot from two variables in the built-in
car engine data set.

To get comfortable using RMarkdown, try taking the original "A_gentle_introduction_to_R" script and copying the lines of code to code chunks and describing what each chunk of code does in the white space after each code chunk. Give each code chunk a unique name. For now, don't add `echo = FALSE` or `eval = FALSE` to the chunks. When you're ready, click the "Knit" button to create a nice-looking document containing both the code for and results of a particular analysis.
